# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian Vault for the "퇴직준비 세미나" (Retirement Preparation Seminar) - a training program focused on AI tools and personal knowledge management.

## Structure

This vault uses the PARA method for organization:
- `1. Projects/` - Active projects with deadlines
- `2. Areas/` - Ongoing areas of responsibility
- `3. Resources/` - Reference materials and learning notes
- `4. Archives/` - Completed or inactive items

## Working with this Vault

- All content files are Markdown (`.md`)
- The `.obsidian/` folder contains Obsidian settings - avoid modifying unless specifically requested
- New notes should be placed in the appropriate PARA folder
- Use Korean language for content unless otherwise specified

## Version Control

This vault is Git-tracked. When committing:
- Write commit messages in Korean to match the content language
- Exclude `.obsidian/workspace.json` from commits (changes frequently with UI state)
