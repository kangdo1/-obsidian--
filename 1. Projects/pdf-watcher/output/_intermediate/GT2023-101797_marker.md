#### **ABSTRACT**

GE Gas Power is nearing completion of technology development towards a retrofittable Dry Low NOx (DLN) combustion system for F-Class gas turbines. The "DLN Evo" combustor is envisioned to give existing power plants a path to decarbonize by significantly increasing their Hydrogen capability vs. current GE DLN systems. Hydrogen may be from any source be it electrolysis, reforming, ammonia, or other. Further attributes of the DLN Evo that may benefit operators include reduced min turndown load, reduced NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. reduced startup emissions, and increased fuel flexibility compared to today's DLN 2.6+ based systems. This program builds on previous internal technology development programs, previous collaborations with the US Department of Energy, and the successfully fielded DLN 2.6e combustion system currently in operation on the latest GE HA class gas turbines. The DLN Evo combustor is the application of GE Gas Power's latest experience and most advanced technology to F-Class as turbines.

This paper describes innovative approaches and technologies applied to create the new system. The Three Key Technology elements are the Compact Flames Micro Mixer (CFMM), Next Gen Axial Fuel Staging (NG-AFS) injectors, and unibody cooling that integrates with the Axial Fuel Stage (AFS). These technologies are, for the first time, applied to a canannular system, and further advanced through extensive analytical simulation and screened via subscale testing at GE Research (GER). The full-scale system was manufactured and has completed a series of shakedown tests at GE Gas Power's Gas Turbine Technology Lab (GTTL) in Greenville SC. Initial test results are summarized within.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The power sector is in period of a transition as it rebalances energy sources with the retirement of carbon intensive generators, rapid growth of renewables and development of disrupting technologies such as storage, hybrid, and digitalization. The role of Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (GTCC) in the energy transition will be key to balance affordable energy, maintain reliable power supply, and improve sustainability. In certain countries the gas sector will only have a role in the future of energy if it can decarbonize. The latest generation of GE Gas Turbines (GT) in the HA family were configured to face these future challenges. On the other hand, older GTs may require significant upgrades to operate in the grids of tomorrow and compete with more modern plants. To that end, GE is currently developing a new combustor to retrofit the large fleet of F-class units worldwide, which will deliver high-H2 capability, ability to turn down to very low load, and reduced emissions levels, while improving operability of the engine. These features will make F-class turbines invaluable assets for those who need to balance energy sources.

One approach for transitioning towards carbon-free power is the use of H2 as an energy carrier. To that end, some countries plan to build dedicated H2 pipelines, while in others the transition will take place by blending H2 into Natural Gas (NG) pipelines [1, 2]. The challenges associated with this new infrastructure are significant. From the CO2-free generation of immense quantities of H2 to transport and storage, it will take decades to reach a point where a majority of GTs can operate solely on H2[3]. However, certain regions will get there sooner, and GE is committed to delivering the technology required to support this transition. Figure 1 shows a progression of carbon emissions reduction, starting first with coal switching and terminating with combined cycle GTs fueled with 100% carbon free H2. The DLN Evo represents a step from 55% to 81% carbon avoidance along this path.

FIGURE 1: Pathway to low or near-zero carbon power [4]

The development of a new combustor with high-H<sup>2</sup> capability comes with its own challenges. These include controlling the combustion process to maintain a stable flame while keeping emissions levels below regulatory limits and protecting combustion hardware from Flash Back (FB) and Flame Holding (FH) risks. Retrofitting of a fielded GT increases complexity as the new combustor must fit within the boundary conditions and constraints of the existing engine. Furthermore, maintaining the exit temperature profile of the combustor is key for downstream components. Indeed, hot gas path parts were configured with cooling features strategically located on their hottest sections. A change in exit temperature profile can reduce the life of those components. The DLN Evo program is set to address all these challenges based on decades of combustion technology development experience at GE. This paper presents key features of the DLN Evo combustor and reports successful initial combustion test results.

## 1.1 GE Gas Power Hydrogen Experience

GE Gas Power is an industry leader in the manufacture and service of GTs and power plants that operate on high-H2 fuels. GE Gas Power's installed base includes more than one hundred units with over eight million operating hours on H2 fuel and H<sup>2</sup> blends.

Today's portfolio of engines with diffusion combustors is capable of operation up to 100% H2 for E and F class GTs and up to 85% vol H2 for aeroderivative engines. The fleet has H<sup>2</sup> experience spanning more than four decades with applications such as refineries, coal gasification, steel mills, and other chemical processes where synthetic gases are produced. Figure 2 summarizes current and future capability with respect to H<sup>2</sup> addition into NG. Values are shown in %volume.

![](_page_1_Figure_10.jpeg)

FIGURE 2: GE'S CURRENT PORTFOLIO CAPABILITY [4]

Engines with premixed combustors producing lower emissions without diluent also have capability to burn H2 blends. Current new unit ratings are up to 35% vol H2 for aeroderivative Dry Low Emissions (DLE) technology. E-Class GTs featuring DLN 1 technology can reach 32% vol. F-class engines with DLN 2.6+ combustors are capable of up to 20% vol. DLN 1 combustors have shown reliable operation with H2 content in the fuel near the maximum rating for over a decade.

The premixed combustor with the highest capability on the portfolio is the DLN 2.6e provided on the 9HA and 7HA.03 with current ratings up to 50% H2 vol. The combustion architecture for the 9HA GT is derived from an advanced premixer technology, which was developed to operate on high-H2 fuels. It has superior FH/FB, emissions, and operability characteristics, which enables market leading fuel flexibility. The experience for this combustor includes:

- Over 1,000 hours of combustion lab testing on various fuels and engine conditions including full operability mapping on blends of H2 up to 50% vol into NG
- Field operation since Q3 2019 with accumulated operation over 50,000 hours across twelve units on NG as of December 2022.

## 1.2 Approaches to H2 Combustion

As previously discussed, H2 brings with it some added difficulties. It can be difficult to achieve low NOx due to the propensity of premixed approaches to pull the flame into the premixer. Depending on the scenario, this is referred to as either Flash Back or Flame Holding. Both result in hardware damage. Premixing is seen as critical for low NOx operation and is a common aspect of most DLE or DLN approaches today. If premixing is limited due to FB or FH, then NOx increases. There are, however, ways to address FH, FB, and NOx through changes in geometry.

Multiple groups [5,6,7] have explored Lean Direct Injection (LDI) approaches using "In Situ" premixing, i.e., mixing that occurs rapidly in the same regions where the reactions take place. The strength of these approaches is that with fuel injection on the hot side, there is no possibility for FH or FB. The drawback is that it is difficult to achieve adequate mixing to avoid high NOx generation at high cycle temperatures. Premixed methods such as Micro Mixing have gained favor for H2 combustion with teams from GE [8], Siemens [9], Hitachi [10], and Doosan [11] all pursuing concepts. Micro Mixer with H2 has merit due to rapid mixing in short lengths and the use of pressure drop across the premixer to generate high axial velocity to push out the flame.

Forms of Axial Staging are in use by GE [12], Siemens [13], and Ansaldo [14] due to decreased effective residence time. Lowering the time at elevated temperature lowers NOx emissions [15]. When unfueled, the axial stage also acts as an air bypass which extends turndown [12].

GE Gas Power has decades of experience with wellpremixed configurations and approaches to lowering NOX. This is preferred internally over LDI approaches as well-premixed combustors can approach entitlement NOx levels [16]. At levels of H2 up to 80% vol, a well premixed head end based on Micro Mixing technology gives a stable, low NOX, and H2-capable head end solution. The addition of an axial stage further reduces NO<sup>X</sup> emissions by reducing effective residence time, distributes the heat release which aids stability, and extends turndown capability. All of GE's advanced H2-capable DLN systems are expected to include variations of these two technologies.

# 1.3 Common Technology Approach

GE's combustion technologies are applicable separately or in combination to all frames and cycles. That may mean the leveraging the same part number, such as the Micro Mixer (MM) assembly that is common to the 9HA.01, 9HA.02, and 7HA.03. In other scenarios, it may be an application of the same philosophy using a common set of data and practices to guide the engineering for a specific application. As an example, the E, F, and HA AFS systems were engineered simultaneously, using one common set of tools and fundamental data. An advantage of this approach is that as technology improvements become available, they provide benefits across the portfolio.

AFS was introduced on E-Class GTs in 2011 [18]. AFS and Unibody (UB) were applied to the 60Hz 7HA.01 in 2016 [12]. In 2018 the first 9H.02 GTs were commissioned at Malaysia Track 4A [19, 20]. These engines featured the UB approach from the 7HA, an improved AFS injector, and for the first time a MMbased head end. This system is referred to as the DLN 2.6e. When the first 7HA.03 launched at Florida Power and Light's Dania Beach site in 2022 [21], it did so with the same MM from the 9HA along with an updated UB and further improved AFS injectors. In the future, the 7HA.03 improved AFS injectors will flow back to the 9HA and other systems as opportunities arise.

Although AFS has now been successfully applied to E, F [22], and HA GTs, MM and UB have to date only been applied to GE HA GTs. The DLN Evo technology development program is the first application of MM and UB technologies to F-Class.

F-Class was chosen as the target cycle for the DLN Evo as these are currently the least capable of GE's large frame DLN products in terms of H2. It is also a large fleet of engines with over 1,500 in service between 50 and 60Hz. The standard F-Class Flex (DLN 2.6+) combustor is limited to 10-20% H2 vol today. In addition, the turndown capability of the Flex is on the order of 40% GT load, though turndown improves to ~26% GT load with the inclusion of a small AFS system. By applying UB, a MM-based head end, and an AFS system with a large air split to the F-Class we would expect to see similar capability as what is available on the DLN 2.6e. Rather than porting the exact DLN 2.6e MM and AFS geometry to F-class, the DLN Evo program has developed versions more suitable to the physically smaller F-class engine and with increased performance through the inclusion of new technology. Though the F-Class was chosen for initial introduction of the DLN Evo, the technologies are equally applicable to the E, HA, aeroderivative, reheat, and other engines. Programs are currently underway to apply advanced versions of MM and AFS to E-class engines.

# 2. DLN EVO PROTOTYPE

This technology development program is intended to demonstrate a retrofittable upgrade package for existing F-Class GTs. It builds upon the DLN 2.6e UB, MM, and AFS architecture. The goal is to bring together the best approaches currently in use on the higher performing HA class GTs, as well as technologies that have been in the technology development pipeline to offer capabilities that enable existing F-class GTs to be successful in a decarbonized energy future. The DLN Evo technology demonstrator has several high-level goals:

- 1. Robust operation on fuel blends of 0-80% H2 in NG. This is accomplished through application of the CFMM which features revised geometry and higher tube velocities to enable increased FH capability when operating on high-H<sup>2</sup> blends. It also requires a highly H2-capable AFS injector, which was a major focus of this project.
- 2. Turndown to at least 10% load in emissions compliance. This is accomplished through the application of large Axial Fuel Stages as well as the CFMM which has a wider emissions compliant range than current MM systems.
- 3. Deliver lower NOx than the current system (9-25 ppm depending on cycle) while running with 80% H2. This is accomplished by applying the UB, which eliminates the combustion liner to Transition Piece (TP) interface and associated leakages and cooling air. A large and late Axial Fuel Stage has the added benefit of cutting thermal NOx production. As always it is important for the premixers, here the CFMM & NG-AFS, to be well-mixed. This is an example of where GE is applying technology to more than offset any increase in NOx due to H2.

The goal of the prototype is to demonstrate what is possible, and to give the team the opportunity to meet and overcome the inevitable challenges that come along with developing technologies and applying them for the first time. This prototype is a superset of features and technologies. Future commercial offerings may come in different forms that offer combinations of features and technologies selected to deliver customerdetermined requirements.

It is worthwhile to note that 80% H2 in NG is ~55% CO<sup>2</sup> avoidance. While a step forward from the current F or HA combustors, there is still a gap to 100% CO2 avoidance. As shown in Figure 3, the challenge associated with H2 is not linear with respect the fraction measured in %vol. In this figure, laminar flame speed is shown as a surrogate for reactivity calculated over a range of H2 fraction from 0-85% in NG for Fclass cycle conditions. This plot was created using Cantera and GRI 3.0. The higher the laminar flame speed, the more difficult it is to make a premixer robust to FH, FB, and overtemperature. The approach with the DLN Evo is to deliver a large step up in H2 capability as soon as possible, with a mechanical structure that is manufacturable using techniques and capabilities in use on the HA today. GE Gas Power envisions this new architecture will be upgraded over time to reach 100% H2 capability. Followon programs to take this architecture to 100% H2 are currently in process.

FIGURE 3: CONTINUUM OF REACTIVITY

## 2.1 Three Key Technologies

The versions of the MM, AFS, and UB cooling applied for this prototype have their roots in previous technology programs. These were most recently progressed under the US Department of Energy "Multi-Tube Mixer for 65% Efficiency" program, FE0023965. That program applied what we called the Three Key Technologies and implemented them into a fourth technology, the Integrated Combustion Nozzle (ICN) itself.

The Three Key Technologies are:

- 1. Compact Flames Micro Mixer, CFMM
- 2. Next Gen Axial Fuel Staging, NG-AFS
- 3. Advanced Cooling, integrated with NG-AFS

Figure 4 shows the ICN, which resembles an elongated stage 1 stationary turbine vane with multiple NG-AFS injectors positioned in the vertical wall of each vane on both sides. The CFMM head end can be seen at the forward end (upper left) capping off the forward boundary of the combustion zone. An advanced cooling system which impinges and then feeds air into the ICN and to the NG-AFS injectors is also shown.

![](_page_3_Picture_15.jpeg)

FIGURE 4: THREE KEY TECHNOLOGIES [23]

The Compact Flames Micro Mixer is a package of features and approaches. Its construction is geometrically like the High-H2 MM geometries explored under US Department of Energy program DE-FC26-05NT42644 in that it is a 1-piece 3D printed part [8, 24]. Differences include larger dimensions and fuel holes are added post-print. It uses an air-cooled aft face, which cools the face while operating on both gas fuel and any type of liquid backup fuel. CFMM also draws on the learning from a more recent internally funded technology development program which determined geometric features to improve turndown and low temperature stability of MM-type premixers.

Next Gen Axial Fuel Staging is a type of AFS injector that features an innovative two air stream approach. A fraction of the NG-AFS air is first used to cool the combustor, taking a healthy pressure drop. The remainder of the air has full pressure drop available to it and is mixed with the low-pressure post-cooling air in an ejector arrangement. Fuel is injected near the ejector section. This approach allows the system to simultaneously achieve low system pressure drop, high AFS injector exit velocity for FH tolerance, and ample pressure ratio for cooling of the combustor. The interaction of the two air streams has the effect of producing rapid mixing in a compact package.

The advanced cooling found on the ICN uses AFS air to first cool the body before travelling to a nearby collection duct where it is conveyed to the NG-AFS injectors. The DLN Evo uses the same approach with the added benefit of retaining a traditional impingement sleeve approach, as is found on today's F-class GTs. Rather than post impingement air travelling past AFS injectors to go to the head end, it travels to the nearest NG-AFS injector. This approach allows additional dP/P and therefore tube velocity for the CFMM while holding system dP/P. Adverse cycle impacts are avoided despite tube velocities exceeding those of the production DLN 2.6e system by some margin.

#### 2.2 Conceptual System Layout

The DLN Evo applies these three key technologies to a canannular system for the first time. Further evolution occurred as they were retargeted away from high exit temperature and low combustor dP/P, and towards increasing H2 and turndown capability. For a retrofit, combustor exit temperature and dP/P are fixed.

The team started with a current DLN 2.6+ combustor as found on F-class GTs. As this is intended to be a retrofittable package, it must obey the space constraints of the current system. Figure 5 shows a representative view of the available envelope as viewed from inside the engine. Constraints include a set diameter port in the Compressor Discharge Casing (CDC) through which the combustor must pass as indicated by the blue arrow. There are also struts that run from the forward face of the CDC where the cans mount, towards the engine centerline to support the inner barrel. These struts, indicated by the red arrows, cannot be modified, or removed without wholesale replacement of the CDC. The port in the CDC and the struts determined the envelope into which the UB and AFS system must install.

FIGURE 5: AVAILABLE COMBUSTOR ENVELOPE

Fuel supply robustness is paramount when dealing with a highly reactive fuel such as H2. For this reason, the team adopted the AFS fueling approach used for HA engines. Figure 6 shows that approach in principle. In this embodiment, there are no internal fittings or seals to leak high-H2 fuel. All internal connections are welded. A bellows assembly provides thermal compliance to the AFS fuel supply assembly to allow for differences in thermal expansion of the cold fuel tube vs. the hot casing and UB. The bellows assembly is bolted to the hot side of the casing with an air-to-air seal. Shields are positioned over the bellows and fuel tubes to protect the bellows and fuel tubing from damage during shipping or installation. This is a mechanically robust approach.

![](_page_4_Figure_10.jpeg)

FIGURE 6: HA-STYLE AFS FUELING APPLIED TO F-CLASS UNIBODY

Figure 6 also shows the two reaction zones. The overall combustor equivalence ratio is on the order of 0.55 at Full Speed Full Load (FSFL) conditions with NG fuel. Fuel is split between the CFMM and NG-AFS. For systems with AFS the lowest NOx emissions occur at a global fuel split where the AFS receives more fuel than the head end. Optimal AFS fuel split for NO<sup>X</sup> emissions is between 1.1 and 1.3 times the air split, depending on system parameters. The CFMM then receives a lower split of the fuel relative its air split and runs cooler.

Of the available space in the opening of the CDC, AFS fuel supply components take up several centimeters of radial height around the periphery of the head end. This reduces the available diameter for the head end. By defining the space required for the AFS fueling components, the CFMM head end occupies the remaining available space. The available diameter for the package is smaller than the DLN 2.6e MM with the overall face area reduced by approximately 50%. The number of mixing ducts and the allowable head end air flow are defined by the target tube velocity and CFMM parameters. As a retrofit the current cycle conditions are fixed. Subtracting the head end air flow from the total combustor air flow gives the total AFS air flow.

The team adopted a UB architecture. This removed the normal leakage and cooling at the liner-to-TP interface which maximizes air to the premixers and lowers NOx. It also allowed the AFS injectors to be placed as far aft as required for avoidance of thermal NOx formation [12]. Like the DLN 2.6e, the DLN Evo combustor consists of two major self-contained assemblies, the UB assembly and MM assembly. To install the system, the UB assembly is installed as a unit, and then the MM assembly is installed as a unit. This has benefits in terms of outage duration over older systems that featured more individual parts that were installed one by one. Referring again to Figure 6, the MM assembly can be identified in as the three items in shades of purple. The remainder of the system is part of the UB assembly.

Another hard requirement is compatibility with the current hot gas path components. The geometry at the aft end of the UB was therefore fixed to ensure compatibility with the current stage 1 turbine vane and mounting structures. The target exhaust temperature profile is also fixed.

An early system layout was completed. A formal review of the program was held, and the program received the authorization to proceed into the conceptual technology development phase.

#### 2.3 Conceptual Technology Development

This system rapidly progressed through conceptual technology development. The key areas of work break down into the UB, CFMM, NG-AFS, cooling, and engineering for dynamics.

#### 2.3.1 Unibody

One of the key parameters for any system is the distribution of volume and therefore residence time (res) between stages. res between the CFMM and NG-AFS must balance NOx and CO emissions at F-class cycle conditions. As such the residence times are longer than what appears in the HA DLN 2.6e system, but still significantly shorter than the DLN 2.6+ system that it replaces.

The prototype UB was created by modifying an existing TP. The production impingement sleeves were removed. The forward end of the TP was removed and extended along the forward axis of the combustor to encompass the target total hotside volume. Once the AFS injector counts, sizes and locations were known, mounting bosses were printed and welded into the UB.

## 2.3.2 Compact Flames Micro Mixer

As previously discussed, CFMM is a derivative of the original High-H2 MM and uses the same one-piece 3D printed construction. For this combustor, the size is small, <50% of the area of the DLN 2.6e. As a result, the team chose a single printed CFMM plenum that incorporates the multiple fuel circuits and aft face air cooling. The tube layout is hexagonal with uniform spacing. The locations of key features are shown in Figure 7. There is one center fuel plenum feed and separate fuel feeds to the outer fuel plenums. Six outer passthroughs allow liquid fuel cartridges, dynamic pressure measurements, ignition means, and allow for other potential future uses. There is also a central passthrough that may be used for future high-H2 programs as an ignitor, pilot, damper, camera, etc. This CFMM package is meant to be a platform that future programs can modify and improve over time.

![](_page_5_Figure_13.jpeg)

FIGURE 7: CFMM HEAD END LAYOUT

The aft face of the CFMM is cooled partially by the air and fuel mixture exiting the mixing ducts at high velocity. Steps were taken to enhance this effect as much as possible. Additional aircooling features were distributed over the aft face aiming to ensure low temperatures and long-term durability. Both full and subscale reacting CFD models were used to improve the geometry of the cooling features. Several small parts were printed in the target alloy and flowed to determine the effective area of the as-printed cooling features with inherently rough surfaces.

## 2.3.3 Next Gen Axial Fuel Staging

The two main areas of activity for the NG-AFS system were the count and placement of injectors on the UB and the detailed engineering of the injectors themselves.

The location and orientation of the injectors was critical for emissions and exit temperature profile. An optimization framework was applied to determine the best location and orientation via reacting RANS CFD. Each configuration was simulated at the corner points of the operating sequence. That is the high and low end of the temperature range of each combustion mode. These cases were run using ANSYS Fluent, using standard inbuild Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) in conjunction with a proprietary turbulent flame speed closure model. The FGM model is suitable for this AFS application as it covers the entire range of S-curve including both ignition and quenching. This model also captures the mixing of the AFS and cross flow, which is critical for accurate prediction [12]. Particle tracking was used to calculate effective res for each injector. This data was used to position the injectors fore and aft to achieve the target res. Combustor exit temperature profile was also tabulated and fed back into the optimization. The final AFS locations and orientations were then locked down, boss geometries were modeled, printed, and welded into the UB.

Making the new system retrofittable in terms of spatial constraints was a challenge. The available system envelope imposed strict restrictions on the allowable height of the AFS injectors. The injectors needed to incorporate the ejector approach to integrate with UB cooling, and the handoff of flow from those UB cooling features to the AFS injector had to be considered. To achieve low NOX, the spatial fuel-air unmixedness at the exit of the injector needed to be low. It also had to be manufacturable and robust to FH & FB at 80% vol H2.

The team set out to create three or more distinct approaches to NG-AFS for fired testing. Each of the configurations created share aspects of the ICN's NG-AFS injector shown in Figure 8. This injector incorporates the mixing of the two air streams and a fuel stream in a short package with low unmixedness. Much of the work in this program was to optimize H2 capability via a coupled design and analysis approach.

### 2.3.4 Advanced Cooling

Unlike a traditional GE combustor, the air that cools the combustor does not go to the head end. Rather, AFS air is used for cooling which unburdens the head end air, allowing greater dP/P across the CFMM. For the cooling of the UB the team adopted a traditional impingement sleeve which impinges and then allows the post-impingement air to travel to the nearest NG-AFS injector in the annulus between the UB and the impingement sleeve. Figure 9 illustrates the short path that the air might take from post-impingement to the different NG-AFS injectors. The color contours shown are impingement heat transfer coefficients from a non-reacting heat transfer simulation using ANSYS Fluent.

### 2.3.5 Combustion Dynamics

GEs latest dynamics modeling capability was brought to bear. Throughout the process, models were created and updated using the commercial finite element code COMSOL. These models were used to drive changes to the hardware with the goal of minimizing combustion dynamics. They also facilitated the placement of multiple types of acoustic dampers in locations throughout the system. Figure 10 shows the output of one such model run at a low frequency. The colors show that this is a first longitudinal mode. Other modes such as transverse or higher order longitudinal modes are calculated at higher frequencies. The COMSOL model was swept over a range of frequencies to first determine the acoustic response and mode shapes in the air side of the system. Fuel-side models were also generated and exercised in a comparable manner. These two were then coupled with a knowledge of the flame transfer function to predict a Rayleigh gain for each frequency. Geometry and system parameters were altered to drive the Rayleigh gains to negative in order ensure stability of each mode.

#### 2.3 Trial Prints and Manufacturing

Trial prints were completed using EOS and SLM manufactured 3D printers at GE's Advanced Manufacturing Works (AMW). The materials used for the print are suitable for short duration testing with H2. The team printed three successively more detailed CFMM configurations. All were similar in terms of the number and locations of mixing ducts and key features, however the complexity of the internals and cooling features increased with each trial.

Through the print trials, lessons were learned about the level of difficulty in powder removal, the quality of the print, print parameters, etc. Builds failed and the geometry and/or build parameters had to be altered to address the reasons for those failures. A comprehensive CT inspection and cut-up plan was executed to learn as much as possible from these parts. After the three build trials were successfully completed and the final dimensions solidified, two identical parts were printed for fired testing.

Trial builds were also completed for the impingement sleeve, AFS bosses, and NG-AFS components. Once the trial parts were complete and required alterations were incorporated the hardware for GER subscale and GTTL full scale testing was manufactured in house at AMW.

#### 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

# 3.1 GER Test Campaign, Subscale Validation

A short subscale test campaign was completed at GER in mid-2022. This consisted of scoping tests on ten CFMM variants and four NG-AFS injector variants. The dimensions of the CFMM were full geometric scale in terms of each tube's dimensions, but with a lower tube count than the engine CFMM head end. The design of the NG-AFS injectors tested was identical to the engine counterparts, apart from the length, which was ~3/4 that of the engine hardware. The testing was run with full pressure, temperature, and flow conditions as they would be experienced on an engine. The focus of this testing was FH & FB performance with elevated levels of H2.

The rig featured an optically accessible hot section, which allowed the team to detect FH and FB visually. Figure 11 shows what can be viewed on the main camera during testing. Thermocouples and static pressures were also added to further aid detection, however visual detection was sufficient to determine FH and FB in most cases. Unfortunately, aspects of the rig also impacted the emissions. Emissions data is useful only in a comparative sense and are therefore not presented here.

FIGURE 11: GER OPTICALLY ACCESSIBLE RIG

H2 was supplied from gaseous tube trailers. H2/NG blends between 0 and 100% were heated in the test cell. A summary of GER's subscale test capabilities can be found in [26].

The process used for FH testing is described in [27]. When operating on 100% H2 the fuel-air ratio was initially low and was increased until the FH test was failed, or FB was encountered. In future tests the team may probe the FB boundary at more extreme conditions.

#### 3.1.1 CFMM Testing

Each of the ten variants featured a combination of mixing duct and fuel hole parameters. All configurations cleared FH torch test at 70% vol H2 at nominal fuel-air ratio. A subset of the configurations tested passed the torch test at 100% H2 with varying fuel-air ratio. Figure 12 shows one of the more capable configurations running on 100% H2 at higher than cycle fuel-air ratio. Configurations that could run with 100% H2 were in general higher NOx configurations regardless of the fuel composition. There is currently a tradeoff between NOx and FH/FB capability. Longer mixing length or vigorous stirring inside the premixer helps mixing and thereby NOx but is detrimental to FH/FB. There is more work required to achieve 100% H2 and low NOx simultaneously. The nominal CFMM geometry in use for the DLN Evo was both well mixed and able to pass the FH torch test at more than 80% vol H2 in NG. There were no changes required for DLN Evo prototype.

#### 3.1.2 NG-AFS Testing

NG-AFS injectors were tested in place of the CFMM in the head end of the subscale rig rather than being tested in cross flow. Figure 13 shows the generic mounting boss used to mount four different NG-AFS injectors for testing. This common boss was a simplification made to assess injector geometries quickly and inexpensively.

FIGURE 13: SUBSCALE RIG NG-AFS INJECTOR ADAPTER

Four NG-AFS injector configurations, A – D, were tested. The thresholds in terms of FH are listed in Table 1 for all configurations. Where available the FB threshold is also listed. These thresholds were obtained at engine FSFL cycle conditions.

TABLE 1: AFS INJECTOR SUBSCALE RESULTS

| AFS Injector | Threshold<br>% H2, vol | Flash Back<br>% H2, vol |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Α            | 88%                    | No Data                 |
| В            | 82.5%                  | 88%                     |
| С            | 77%                    | No Data                 |
| D            | 81.5%                  | 86%                     |

All but one injector passed the FH torch test at higher than 80% vol H2. As this was the first test on each of these injector types, there appears to be a solid foundation to improve upon during the product development process. There was not sufficient time available to attempt to characterize the FB boundary on all configurations. The team envisions returning to GER with enhanced configurations in the future and pushing to more challenging conditions.

Figure 14 shows the FH test sequence carried out with greater than 80% vol H2 on Configuration "A" at nominal cycle conditions.

## 3.2 Full Scale Validation, GE Gas Power GTTL

The goal of this ongoing test campaign is to validate the assumptions that the DLN Evo system is built on, as well as to solidify performance benefits. A full suite of testing is planned for 2023. The scope of the 2022 test campaign was to shake down the test stand and combustor hardware and gather initial data. The first two shakedown tests were completed in early December 2022, totaling 26 hours. A summary of the initial results is presented in this section.

23 PCB piezoelectric dynamic pressure sensors measured dynamic pressure amplitudes throughout the cold, hot, and fuel sides of the system. Figure 15 shows calculated FFT output from a standard measurement location on the hot side of the combustor using a wave guide that passes through the CFMM. The values shown are peak-to-peak amplitude normalized by the upstream chamber pressure. The multiple curves are for the same location with different operating conditions and fuels. P' was mostly under 0.5% throughout the test, except for certain fuel splits with low H2. The system ran over a range of conditions, from below Full Speed No Load (FSNL) to above FSFL. The traces demonstrate the large range of fuel reactivity and MWI explored. Each of these traces are at FSFL conditions and the "Best  $NO_X$ " fuel split, which normally coincides with the highest dynamic pressure amplitudes.

FIGURE 15: FSFL COMBUSTION DYNAMICS SPECTRUMS WITH DIFFERENT FUEL COMPOSITIONS AT "BEST NOX" FUEL SPLITS

As there were no significant boundaries encountered, the team was able to run the system through the full range of fuel splits to confirm the best fuel distribution for  $NO_X$  and CO emissions. Figure 16 shows the best  $NO_X$  achievable in the shakedown test vs. combustor exit temperature. Also shown is the current DLN 2.6+ technology found on 7F and 9F GE GTs. DLN Evo's NOx is approximately one third that of the current DLN 2.6+ system at the nominal cycle condition.

FIGURE 16: NG NO<sub>X</sub> EMISSIONS VS. TEMPERATURE

CO emissions for the three operating modes are shown in Figure 17. This data was gathered while operating on 100% NG. An operating mode features a unique grouping of fuel circuits actively fueled. At lower loads, less fuel circuits receive fuel, which keeps the fueled circuits hot enough to burn out their CO. There are several modes in which the system can operate at less than 10ppm CO. NOx emissions were between 5 and 25ppmvd corrected to 15% O<sub>2</sub>. The goal of emission compliance (< 9ppm

NOx and CO) at 10% GT load appears achievable with continued development.

FIGURE 17: CO VS. % GT LOAD FOR VARIOUS MODES

Figure 18 shows the increase in NOx emissions vs. H<sub>2</sub> %vol in NG. This is an increase over the NOx at the same conditions and fuel splits with 100% NG. Data was gathered at full scale FSFL conditions with no temperature derate and no significant dynamics. Part of the increase in NOx can be attributed to effects of increased H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the reacted products, which impacts the corrections in an unfavorable way [28]. At 50% vol H<sub>2</sub>, the impact of the corrections is  $\sim$ 1.07 multiplier. The black triangle shows the current DLN 2.6+ at the same conditions and at the Best NOx fuel splits in comparison to DLN Evo's 100% NG emissions. Advanced combustion technologies applied as part of the DLN Evo package more than overcomes any NOx increase due to H<sub>2</sub>. It is expected that as the team works to understand the increase in NOx and what drives it, further reductions will be possible. NOx emissions are not expected to limit the DLN Evo combustor's H<sub>2</sub> capability.

FIGURE 18: HYDROGEN BLEND NO<sub>X</sub> EMISSIONS

Figure 19 shows the maximum P' in any frequency range. At "Even Split" dynamics were low from 0% to 50% H<sub>2</sub>. Even fuel split is where the fuel and air splits are identical, resulting in both reaction zones operating at the same temperature. This is typically not optimal for NO<sub>X</sub> in AFS systems but is often a challenging condition for dynamics. At the "Best NO<sub>X</sub>" fuel

splits at 30%, 40%, and 50%  $\rm H_2$  amplitudes were slightly higher, but still well within the internal design practice limits that would be required for a fully developed production-ready system. With 10 and 20%  $\rm H_2$  dynamics levels limited the operating range to where the system was not able to run at the "Best NOx" fuel splits without dynamics above the transient lab test limits. This highlights the non-monotonic impact of  $\rm H_2$  on dynamics. Nevertheless, the ability to run NG, 50%  $\rm H_2$ , and some levels in between is encouraging for a first test with no adjustments to any of the available tunable features (damper parameters, fuel hole parameters, etc.).

The UB featured multiple cameras. Some had a view of the CFMM aft face, and others had a view of NG-AFS injectors. Figure 20 shows one of the CFMM facing cameras and one of the NG-AFS facing cameras. For the CFMM, the image shown is from low load operation with low inlet temperature and methane fuel. In this condition flames were clearly distinct and elongated. The camera observing the NG-AFS injectors had a clear view throughout the testing. A NG flame downstream of the slot shaped NG-AFS injector can be clearly see in Figure 20. The CFMM camera became cloudy and more like a flame detector for later test points with H<sub>2</sub>. In future tests these will required to identify FH during torch testing with 80% H<sub>2</sub>. The cameras provided an adequate view of the premixers that will be torch tested in 2023, however additional progress is required to keep the images sharp.

The shakedown tests were highly successful. Performance and metal temperature results were in line with expectations. Combustion dynamics were low throughout most of the test, with notable exceptions being periods with low  $H_2$  levels. Follow-up testing with levels of  $H_2$  up to and beyond 80% vol will continue in early 2023.

#### 4. CONCLUSION

The DLN Evo combustor architecture represents a major leap in capability for existing F-class GTs that should aid their integration into a future decarbonized energy landscape. The Three Key Technologies were successfully applied to a canannular architecture with appropriate modifications. Development of the NG-AFS injectors, the most challenging part of the program, resulted in more than one injector geometry that met the 80% vol H<sub>2</sub> goal in subscale testing. CFMM geometries capable of greater than 80% vol H2 with low NOx were demonstrated in subscale testing. The full system showed impressive combustion dynamics over a wide range of conditions, low NOx emissions, and low turndown. There were few boundaries encountered. Subscale and full-scale data gathered has confirmed assumptions used in the development of the system. The combustor prototype is on track to achieve all program goals. A product development program to create a commercial version of this DLN Evo system is already underway based on strong results from the earlier subscale test campaign.

In 2023 the team will continue full scale testing with higher levels of  $H_2$ , additional mapping, collection of data at other cycles, and FH torch testing of the CFMM and NG-AFS injectors. This data will feed into the product development cycle.

The concepts demonstrated on the F-Class under this program may be applied in part or in whole to E, HA, aeroderivative, and other engines to increase their capabilities in the future.
